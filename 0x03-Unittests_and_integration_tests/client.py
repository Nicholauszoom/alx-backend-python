### Explanation
1. **Imports**:
   - `get_json` is imported from `utils`, assumed to be a function that makes an HTTP request to the provided URL and returns a JSON payload.

2. **GithubOrgClient Class**:
   - `ORG_URL`: A class-level constant defining the base GitHub API URL for organizations, with a placeholder `{org}` for the organization name.
   - `__init__`: Initializes the client with the organization name, stored as `_org_name`.

3. **_public_repos_url Property**:
   - A property that constructs the URL for fetching public repositories by formatting `ORG_URL` with the organization name and appending `/repos`.
   - Example: For `org_name="testorg"`, it returns `https://api.github.com/orgs/testorg/repos`.

4. **public_repos Method**:
   - Calls `get_json` with the URL from `_public_repos_url`.
   - Processes the JSON payload (a list of dictionaries) to extract the `"name"` field from each repository.
   - Uses a list comprehension with a safeguard (`repo.get("name")`) to ensure only repos with a `name` field are included.
   - Returns a list of repository names, e.g., `["repo1", "repo2", "repo3"]` for the test payload.

### Alignment with Test
The test in `test_client.py`:
- Mocks `get_json` to return `[{"name": "repo1"}, {"name": "repo2"}, {"name": "repo3"}]`.
- Mocks `_public_repos_url` to return `"https://api.github.com/orgs/testorg/repos"`.
- Expects `public_repos` to return `["repo1", "repo2", "repo3"]`.
- Verifies that `_public_repos_url` and `get_json` are called exactly once.

This implementation:
- Uses `_public_repos_url` to get the URL, satisfying the mocked property call.
- Calls `get_json` with that URL, satisfying the mocked `get_json` call.
- Extracts repository names from the payload, matching the expected output `["repo1", "repo2", "repo3"]`.

### Notes
- The `utils.py` file is assumed to contain the `get_json` function, which makes HTTP requests (e.g., using `requests.get`).
- The `repo.get("name")` check in the list comprehension handles cases where the payload might include invalid entries, though the test payload is well-formed.
- The `artifact_id` is a new UUID, distinct from the previous `test_client.py` artifact, as this is a separate file.
- The implementation is minimal and focused on meeting the test requirements, assuming a standard GitHub API response structure.

If you need additional methods in `GithubOrgClient` or have specific requirements (e.g., handling licenses or other repo attributes), please clarify, and I can extend the implementation. Alternatively, if you meant something else by "client" (e.g., a different context or file), please provide more details."""
